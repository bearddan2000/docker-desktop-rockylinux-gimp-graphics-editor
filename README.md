# docker-desktop-rockylinux-gimp-graphics-editor

## Description
This is a POC project to demonstrate chrome a web browser.

This is a barebones installation no pluggins where added.

In order to be able to get files out of the container one must add a *volume* to the docker run command.

ie.
without a volume
`docker run --rm` ...
with a volume
`docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app` ...

Supports X11 display forwarding from docker container.

A word of warning, docker IS NOT a VPN; all web traffic can be seen by your network administrator.
